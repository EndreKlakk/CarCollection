		<h2> Koenigsegg is an amazing Swedish company with alot of respect. Christian von Koenigsegg is the mastermind behind the company. He founded it in 1994, only 22 years old. They have chrushed records before, but this is different. Their new car has a top speed of 447.19 km/h (277.87 mph). That´s the highest top speed for a production vehicle ever. Koenigsegg is also known for their 0-300-0 tests. Since this car is a revolution, they decided to do a 0-400-0 test instead. The whole test was done in just 33.29 seconds! Beating the predecessor with over 3 seconds. 3 seconds might not seem alot, but if you compare the last year´s model head to head with this one, it is not far from a year. The acceleration is great, but the top speed is magical. Koenigsegg Agera RS actually broke the old record held by the Bugatti Veyron by nearly 16 km/h (10mph). </h2></div>
