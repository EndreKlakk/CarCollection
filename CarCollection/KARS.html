		<h2> Koenigsegg is an amazing Swedish company with alot of respect. Christian von Koenigsegg is the mastermind behind the company. He founded it in 1994, only 22 years old. They have chrushed records before, but this is different. Their new car has a top speed of 447.19 km/h (277.87 mph). That´s the highest top speed for a production vehicle ever. Koenigsegg is also known for their 0-300-0 tests. Since this car is a revolution, they decided to do a 0-400-0 test instead. The whole test was done in just 33.29 seconds! Beating the predecessor with over 3 seconds. 3 seconds might not seem alot, but if you compare the last year´s model head to head with this one, it is not far from a year. The acceleration is great, but the top speed is magical. Koenigsegg Agera RS actually broke the old record held by the Bugatti Veyron by nearly 16 km/h (10mph). </h2></div>

    	<h3>The Agera RS has broken more than one record. In fact an 80 year old record. The challenge was to have the highest average speed over a distance of 1 km. The old record was held by Rudolf Caracciola. He had an average speed of 432,7 km/h! The car he used was a Mercedes W125. The Agera RS had an average speed of 445,54. About 12 km/h faster. Koenigsegg did not stop there. They fought, and became world champions in four more classes. Their test driver, Niklas Lilja, is not afraid to push the car at a speed of 450 km/h. Even though he would have no chance of surviving if something went wrong.</h3></div>
